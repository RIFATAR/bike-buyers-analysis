# Bike Buyers Analysis Project

This repository contains a simple data analysis project based on the **Bike Buyers** dataset.  The dataset is provided as an Excel workbook and includes information about potential bike customers such as marital status, gender, income, number of children, education level, occupation, home ownership, number of cars, commute distance, geographic region, age, and whether they purchased a bike.

## Dataset

The dataset comes from an Excel file (`Excel Project Dataset.xlsx`) and includes several worksheets:

| Sheet name      | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bike_buyers`   | The main data table containing demographic information and purchase decisions for 1,026 people |
| `Working Sheet` | A cleaned version of the data with additional columns (e.g., age brackets)                    |
| `Pivot Table`   | A pivot table summarizing average income by purchase decision                                 |
| `Dashboard`     | A visual dashboard for high‑level insights                                                   |

In this project we focus on the `bike_buyers` worksheet.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis yourself you will need Python with the `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries installed.  The script `analysis.py` reads the Excel workbook, computes some basic statistics and generates a bar chart showing the number of buyers and non‑buyers by region.

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
python analysis.py
```

## Insights

Some key findings from the analysis:

* **Purchase distribution** – Approximately half of the people in the sample purchased a bike: 495 buyers vs. 531 non‑buyers.
* **Regional differences** – North America has the most customers in the sample and a higher proportion of non‑buyers, while the Pacific region has a relatively higher proportion of buyers.  The chart produced by `analysis.py` illustrates these differences.

## Files

* `Excel Project Dataset.xlsx` – The original Excel workbook containing the data (included here for convenience).
* `analysis.py` – Python script that performs a simple analysis and produces a chart.
* `purchased_by_region.png` – Bar chart showing the count of buyers and non‑buyers by region (generated by the script).
